This project aims to investigate how different countries lockdown approaches and social distancing measures, has impacted the covid-19 confirmed cases growth rate development. Additionally, as the virus development has gone global, our research seeks to analyse the change in the covid-19 online news sentiments and worldwide incidence over time, along with a practical application of machine learning to forecast the number of confirmed cases and even showcase hypothetical scenarios outcomes with different lockdown approaches.
And it mainly focuses on researching the impact of social distancing on COVID-19 spread around different countries.
